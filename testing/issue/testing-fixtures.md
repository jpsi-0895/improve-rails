Good catch — if you’re **not explicitly calling `Product.create`** in your test, but still getting:

> `ActiveRecord::NotNullViolation: Mysql2::Error: Field 'title' doesn't have a default value`

…it likely means something **indirectly is triggering a record creation**, probably from:

---

### 🔍 Possibilities:
#### 1. ✅ **Fixtures loading automatically**

Rails loads fixtures by default for tests. If you have a `products.yml` fixture like this:

```yaml
one:
  price: 10.0
```

...but your `products` table has a `NOT NULL` column like `title`, you'll get that error when Rails tries to insert `products(:one)` during test setup.

✅ **Solution**: Open `test/fixtures/products.yml` and either:
- Add all required fields (`title`, etc.), or
- Delete or comment out the file if you're not using it

---

#### 2. 🔁 **Implicit creation via associations**

If you're testing a controller that loads a related record (like `@product.reviews`), it might trigger creation if not stubbed/mocked.

✅ **Solution**: Check your controller or model callbacks for something like:
```ruby
after_initialize { reviews.build }
```
or
```ruby
has_one :setting, dependent: :create
```

That will cause unexpected inserts!

---

#### 3. ❓ **`test_helper.rb` or `before_setup` creating records**

Check if you have something like this in `test/test_helper.rb`:

```ruby
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  fixtures :all  # 👈 This loads ALL fixtures unless removed!
end
```

✅ **Solution**:
Comment out or remove that line to disable automatic fixture loading:
```ruby
# fixtures :all
```

Then only load what you need manually in individual tests (or none at all).

---

### ✅ What You Can Do Right Now:

1. **Temporarily remove all files from** `test/fixtures/` (or rename them)
2. **Comment out** `fixtures :all` in `test_helper.rb`
3. Rerun the failing test:
```bash
rails test test/controllers/api/products_controller_test.rb
```

If it passes now ✅ — boom, it was a fixture issue! 💥

Let me know if you want help mocking data, or if you'd rather use seeds or factories instead of fixtures.
