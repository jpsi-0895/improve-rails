Great catch 👀 — yes! **Rails 6.1+ and especially Rails 7+** have **built-in support for read replicas**, which lets you **scale read-heavy apps** (like APIs, admin dashboards, mobile clients, SSR content) by automatically routing read queries to replica databases.

Let’s break this down 👇

---

## 🧠 What Are Read Replicas?

Read replicas are **secondary database servers** that replicate the primary DB asynchronously.

- ✅ Used for SELECT queries (reads)
- ❌ Writes/Updates still go to the primary

They reduce load on your primary DB and improve scalability under high traffic.

---

## 🚀 Rails 7+ Built-in Multi-DB Support

Rails has built-in support for:

- Writing to primary
- Reading from replicas (automatically)
- Managing failover
- Connection switching in controllers and jobs

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Using Read Replicas in Rails 7+

---

### 1. **Configure `database.yml`**

Here’s an example using **PostgreSQL** with a replica:

```yaml
production:
  primary:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: myapp_production
    username: myuser
    password: <%= ENV['PRIMARY_DB_PASSWORD'] %>
    host: primary-db.example.com
    pool: 10

  primary_replica:
    replica: true
    adapter: postgresql
    database: myapp_production
    username: myuser
    password: <%= ENV['REPLICA_DB_PASSWORD'] %>
    host: replica-db.example.com
    pool: 10
    reading_role: true
```

---

### 2. **Enable Automatic Query Switching (in `ApplicationController`)**

Rails reads from replicas **only inside `use_read_replica` or `connected_to(role: :reading)` blocks**:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  around_action :switch_to_replica_for_reads

  private

  def switch_to_replica_for_reads
    ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :reading) do
      yield
    end
  end
end
```

OR use `ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :writing)` for writes (usually the default).

---

### 3. **Manually Use Replica in Jobs or Services**

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :reading) do
  Product.find(params[:id]) # hits replica
end
```

Useful in:
- Background jobs (where eventual consistency is okay)
- Analytics queries
- API endpoints

---

### 4. **Avoid Replicas Right After a Write**

Rails doesn’t yet automatically handle replication lag. So, **don’t read from a replica immediately after a write**. Use the primary in that case.

You can wrap those in:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: :writing) do
  # fetch freshly-written records
end
```

---

## ⚙️ Optional: Configure Load Balancing (if multiple replicas)

Rails doesn’t do load balancing natively across replicas, but you can configure your **proxy (like PgBouncer or HAProxy)** or use a **read-write splitting proxy**.

---

## 🔐 Works with Redis-backed Caching Too

You can pair this with:

- **Write-through Redis caching**
- **Background prewarming**
- **Rack::Attack + read replicas** for high-load public APIs

---

## 🧪 Testing Read Replica Behavior

In dev, you can simulate replicas by duplicating config:

```yaml
development:
  primary:
    ...

  primary_replica:
    replica: true
    host: localhost
```

Add a logger to confirm reads go to the replica:

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
```

## 🔥 Summary: Read Replicas in Rails 7+

| Feature                 | Benefit                         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `connected_to(role: :reading)` | Route SELECT queries to replica |
| Safe fallback to primary | Avoid stale reads after writes  |
| Controller-level `around_action` | Easy for API/global behavior |
| Background job friendly | Great for analytics/reporting   |
