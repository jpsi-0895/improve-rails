If you want to use **Redis** for caching a **single record** in **Rails** without relying on `Rails.cache`, you can directly use the **Redis** client to set and get values. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set up Redis for caching a single record (such as a product) and manually handle the cache without the built-in Rails cache store.

### Step 1: Install Redis and the Redis Client Gem

Ensure you have the `redis` gem in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'redis'
```

Then, run `bundle install`:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Redis Client

In Rails, you can configure and initialize Redis directly by creating a custom Redis client in an initializer.

Create an initializer for Redis in `config/initializers/redis.rb`:

```ruby
# config/initializers/redis.rb
$redis = Redis.new(url: ENV['REDIS_URL'] || 'redis://localhost:6379/1')
```

Here, the Redis client is set up globally using the `$redis` variable. This makes Redis available for direct access anywhere in your application.

### Step 3: Create a Service for Caching a Single Record

Create a service class that interacts directly with Redis to cache and fetch a single record (like a **Product**). We will manually handle Redis operations.

#### Example: Caching and Fetching Product by ID

1. **Create the `RecordCacheService` class**:

```ruby
# app/services/record_cache_service.rb
class RecordCacheService
  def initialize(model_class, id)
    @model_class = model_class
    @id = id
    @cache_key = "#{model_class.name.downcase}_#{id}"
  end

  # Fetch the record from Redis or database
  def fetch
    cached_record = get_from_cache
    return cached_record if cached_record

    # If not cached, fetch from DB and cache it
    record = fetch_from_db
    cache(record) if record
    record
  end

  private

  # Get the record from Redis cache
  def get_from_cache
    cached_data = $redis.get(@cache_key)
    return nil unless cached_data

    # Deserialize the cached data (assuming it's stored as JSON)
    JSON.parse(cached_data, object_class: @model_class)
  end

  # Fetch the record from the database
  def fetch_from_db
    @model_class.find_by(id: @id)
  end

  # Cache the record in Redis
  def cache(record)
    # Serialize the record into JSON before caching
    $redis.setex(@cache_key, 10.minutes.to_i, record.to_json)
  end
end
```

### Explanation:

* **`@model_class`** and **`@id`** are passed to the service to identify the specific record (for example, a `Product` model and its `id`).
* **`get_from_cache`**: Attempts to fetch the record from Redis. If the data is found in Redis, it returns it after deserializing (using `JSON.parse`).
* **`fetch_from_db`**: Fetches the record from the database if it's not cached.
* **`cache`**: Caches the fetched record in Redis with an expiration time of 10 minutes (`setex`).

### Step 4: Use the Service in the Controller

Now, in your controller, you can use this service to handle caching logic for a **single product**.

```ruby
# app/controllers/products_controller.rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    # Use the cache service to fetch the product
    cache_service = RecordCacheService.new(Product, params[:id])
    @product = cache_service.fetch

    if @product
      render json: @product, status: :ok
    else
      render json: { message: 'Product not found' }, status: :not_found
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 5: Clear the Cache (Optional)

If you want to clear the cache when the product is updated or deleted, you can use **ActiveRecord callbacks** to invalidate the cache.

```ruby
# app/models/product.rb
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  after_save :clear_cache
  after_destroy :clear_cache

  private

  def clear_cache
    $redis.del("product_#{self.id}")
  end
end
```

### Explanation:

* Whenever a product is updated or deleted, the cache is cleared by calling `$redis.del("product_#{self.id}")`.
* This ensures that the cache stays up-to-date when the product data changes.

### Step 6: Testing the Cache

1. When you first visit `/products/:id`, the cache is **missed** (i.e., no cached data in Redis). The record will be fetched from the database, cached, and returned to the client.
2. On subsequent visits to `/products/:id`, Redis will **hit the cache**, returning the cached product directly without querying the database.

### Example Redis Commands

If you want to check if the product has been cached, you can use `redis-cli`:

```bash
redis-cli get product_1
```

This will show you the cached value of the product with ID `1`. The cached data is stored in **JSON format**, so youâ€™ll likely see a string representation of the serialized product.

---

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can directly use **Redis** to cache a **single record** (like a **Product**) in Rails, without relying on `Rails.cache`. The **`RecordCacheService`** provides a flexible, reusable solution for caching, fetching, and invalidating single records manually.

This approach:

* Uses **Redis** directly via the Redis client (`$redis`).
* Stores the serialized data as **JSON** for easy retrieval.
* Ensures that the cache is updated when the underlying record is modified.
