If you're not seeing any Redis keys when running `redis-cli keys *`, here are some possible reasons — along with how to troubleshoot each one.

---

## 🧩 1. **You're Connected to the Wrong Redis Database or URL**

### 🔍 Check:
```bash
redis-cli
select 1
keys *
```

By default, Redis uses **DB 0**, but your app might be writing to DB 1 or another.

---

### ✅ Fix:
Make sure your Rails app and CLI are using the **same database index** and **same URL**.

In your Rails Redis initializer (`config/initializers/redis.rb`):

```ruby
$redis = Redis.new(url: "redis://localhost:6379/1") # <- DB 1
```

In terminal:

```bash
redis-cli -n 1  # Connect directly to DB 1
keys *
```

---

## 🧩 2. **Key Namespace Prefix**

If you're using something like `Rails.cache` with a namespace:

```ruby
Rails.cache.fetch("product:123", namespace: "myapp_cache")
```

Your keys may be namespaced, e.g.:
```
myapp_cache:product:123
```

### 🔍 Try:
```bash
redis-cli -n 1
keys *product*
```

Or even:
```bash
keys *myapp*
```

---

## 🧩 3. **Keys Expired Automatically**

If your app sets keys with expiry:

```ruby
$redis.set("product:123", data.to_json, ex: 600) # Expires in 10 minutes
```

...and you waited too long, the key is gone. Redis automatically deletes expired keys and they **won’t appear** in `keys *`.

### 🔍 Fix:
Try again right after a product save or run this:

```bash
$redis.set("test_key", "value", ex: 60)
redis-cli -n 1
keys *
```

---

## 🧩 4. **App Didn’t Write the Key**

Ensure the code that writes to Redis is actually being called. You can manually test from Rails console:

```bash
rails c
$redis.set("check_key", "hello", ex: 60)
```

Then:
```bash
redis-cli -n 1
keys *check*
```

If it works, Redis is fine — your background job or controller just isn't calling `.set` as expected.

---

## 🧩 5. **Wrong Redis Instance (Cloud/Container)**

If you're using Docker, Upstash, Heroku Redis, or any remote Redis:

- Your CLI might be connecting to **localhost**, but Rails is writing to **a different Redis instance**
- Your CLI command must use the correct URL:

```bash
redis-cli -u redis://your-host:6379
```

Match this with your `ENV["REDIS_URL"]` value.

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

| 🔍 Check | ✅ What to do |
|---------|---------------|
| Redis DB index | `redis-cli -n 1` or match the DB in your initializer |
| Namespace | `keys *product*`, `keys *myapp*` |
| Key expiration | Try again immediately after write |
| Correct Redis | Match `REDIS_URL` across app and CLI |
| Manual test | Try `$redis.set(...)` in Rails console |

Want help inspecting live keys, or writing a Redis key inspector method in Rails? I can drop that in too.
