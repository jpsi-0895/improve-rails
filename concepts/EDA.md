Event-driven architecture (EDA) in **Rails** is absolutely achievable—and it's a powerful way to **decouple your application logic**, make it more **scalable**, and integrate with external systems like message queues or microservices.

---

## 🧠 What Is Event-Driven Architecture?

In an EDA system:

* Components **emit events** when something happens (e.g., `UserCreated`).
* Other components **subscribe to or consume those events** and act upon them.
* Event emitters **don’t care** who receives the event—this promotes loose coupling.

---

## ✅ Benefits in Rails

* Decouples core business logic from side effects (emails, notifications, auditing).
* Enables async processing via **Sidekiq**, **ActiveJob**, or **external queues** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
* Easier to scale and extend (e.g., adding a new listener doesn’t change the emitter).

## ⚙️ Tools to Build EDA in Rails

| Tool/Gem                       | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ActiveSupport::Notifications` | Lightweight in-app event system            |
| `Wisper`                       | Pub/Sub gem for domain events              |
| `Sidekiq / ActiveJob`          | Background jobs (async event handling)     |
| Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis           | External event/message queues              |
| `RailsEventStore`              | Full-blown event sourcing & CQRS framework |

## 🔧 Basic Event-Driven Setup in Rails (Built-in)

### 1. **Emit an Event**

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
after_create :emit_user_created_event

private

def emit_user_created_event
  ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("user.created", user: self)
end
```

---

### 2. **Subscribe to the Event**

```ruby
# config/initializers/event_subscribers.rb
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("user.created") do |*args|
  event = ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)
  UserMailer.welcome_email(event.payload[:user]).deliver_later
end
```

---

## 🧱 Better Structure with Domain Events

### 1. Create a Domain Event

```ruby
# app/events/user_created_event.rb
class UserCreatedEvent
  attr_reader :user

  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def broadcast
    ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument("user.created", user: user)
  end
end
```

---

### 2. Use in Service or Model

```ruby
UserCreatedEvent.new(@user).broadcast
```

---

## 🌐 External Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)

For larger systems:

* Use gems like [`racecar`](https://github.com/zendesk/racecar) for Kafka
* Use [`shoryuken`](https://github.com/phstc/shoryuken) for AWS SQS
* Or, publish messages to Redis or RabbitMQ using `bunny` or similar clients

```ruby
# Example: Publishing a JSON event
event = { event: "user.created", data: user.as_json }
Redis.current.publish("events", event.to_json)
```

---

## 🚀 Advanced: RailsEventStore (CQRS/ES)

[**RailsEventStore**](https://railseventstore.org/) is a gem that brings **event sourcing**, **command handlers**, and **aggregate roots** to Rails.

### Highlights:

* Persistent event store (can use DB, Kafka, etc.)
* Replayable events
* Supports projections and event versioning

---

## 🔚 Summary

### 🔄 Typical Flow in EDA with Rails

```plaintext
Model / Service
    ↓
Emit Domain Event
    ↓
ActiveSupport::Notifications (or Wisper, etc.)
    ↓
Subscribers (listeners) — mailers, jobs, logs, integrations
```

---

## ✅ Use EDA in Rails When:

* You want to **separate core actions from side effects**
* You need to **scale** actions independently (e.g., sending emails or syncing with CRM)
* You're preparing for a **microservices** architecture or **event sourcing**
