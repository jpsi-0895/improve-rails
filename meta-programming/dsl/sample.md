Perfect! Let's build a **Mini Testing DSL** — a simplified version of something like [RSpec](https://rspec.info/). It will help you understand **how DSLs work**, **how blocks are used**, and **how metaprogramming ties it all together**.

---

## 🧪 Goal: Write tests like this

```ruby
describe "Math" do
  it "adds two numbers" do
    raise "Fail!" unless 2 + 2 == 4
  end

  it "multiplies numbers" do
    raise "Fail!" unless 3 * 3 == 9
  end
end
```

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
mini_test_dsl/
├── test_framework.rb   # Core DSL
├── tests.rb            # Example test file
```

---

## ✏️ Step 1: `test_framework.rb`

```ruby
# test_framework.rb

module MiniTestDSL
  def describe(description, &block)
    puts "\n▶️  #{description}"
    block.call
  end

  def it(description, &block)
    print "  - #{description}: "
    begin
      block.call
      puts "✅ PASS"
    rescue => e
      puts "❌ FAIL (#{e.message})"
    end
  end
end

# Make the DSL available in top-level scope
include MiniTestDSL
```

---

## ✏️ Step 2: `tests.rb`

```ruby
# tests.rb
require_relative "./test_framework"

describe "Math" do
  it "adds two numbers" do
    raise "Wrong addition!" unless 2 + 2 == 4
  end

  it "fails intentionally" do
    raise "Intentional fail" unless 1 + 1 == 3
  end
end

describe "String" do
  it "capitalizes correctly" do
    raise "Bad capitalization!" unless "hello".capitalize == "Hello"
  end
end
```

---

## ▶️ Run It

```bash
ruby tests.rb
```

### ✅ Output:

```
▶️  Math
  - adds two numbers: ✅ PASS
  - fails intentionally: ❌ FAIL (Intentional fail)

▶️  String
  - capitalizes correctly: ✅ PASS
```

## 🧠 What You Just Built

| DSL Method | What it does                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `describe` | Organizes test groupings (like a test suite) |
| `it`       | Defines a test case with a name and a block  |
| `raise`    | Fails the test if the condition is false     |

The blocks (`do ... end`) are passed and executed manually inside your framework — this is the core concept of Ruby DSLs.

---

## 🛠 Ideas to Expand

* 🕒 Show execution time for each test
* 🔁 Add `before_each` / `after_each` hooks
* 📋 Save results to a file
* 🚦 Support nested `describe`
* 📊 Count total passed/failed tests

---

Would you like a version that supports **assertions** like `assert_equal`, or to turn this into a **Gem** you can reuse in other projects?

Let me know and I’ll scaffold it!
