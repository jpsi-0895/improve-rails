Great choice! Building a **DSL (Domain-Specific Language)** in Ruby is a fantastic way to learn metaprogramming. Let’s scaffold a **simple but realistic Ruby DSL project** that you can expand into something more powerful later — like a config file parser, job scheduler, or deployment tool.

---

## 🧱 Project: `SimpleTask` – A Mini Task Runner DSL (like Rake)

We’ll build a DSL that lets you define tasks like this:

```ruby
# taskfile.rb
task "build" do
  puts "Building the project..."
end

task "test" do
  puts "Running tests..."
end
```

Run with:

```bash
ruby simple_task.rb build
```

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
simple_task/
├── simple_task.rb     # CLI entry point
├── task_runner.rb     # DSL logic
├── taskfile.rb        # User-defined tasks
```

---

## ✏️ 1. `task_runner.rb` – Define the DSL

```ruby
# task_runner.rb
class TaskRunner
  def initialize
    @tasks = {}
  end

  def task(name, &block)
    @tasks[name] = block
  end

  def run(name)
    if @tasks.key?(name)
      @tasks[name].call
    else
      puts "Task '#{name}' not found!"
    end
  end

  def tasks
    @tasks.keys
  end
end
```

---

## ✏️ 2. `taskfile.rb` – Example Task File

```ruby
# taskfile.rb
task "build" do
  puts "Building project..."
end

task "test" do
  puts "Running tests..."
end

task "deploy" do
  puts "Deploying to server..."
end
```

---

## ✏️ 3. `simple_task.rb` – Entry Point

```ruby
# simple_task.rb
require_relative "./task_runner"

runner = TaskRunner.new

# Inject DSL into top-level scope
def task(name, &block)
  $runner.task(name, &block)
end

$runner = runner
load "./taskfile.rb"

if ARGV.empty?
  puts "Available tasks: " + runner.tasks.join(", ")
else
  runner.run(ARGV.first)
end
```

---

## ✅ Run It

From the terminal:

```bash
ruby simple_task.rb test
```

Output:

```
Running tests...
```

Or just:

```bash
ruby simple_task.rb
```

Lists:

```
Available tasks: build, test, deploy
```

## 🧠 What You’ve Learned

* How to inject DSL methods (`task`) into top-level scope
* How to store and call blocks dynamically
* How to use `load` to execute code in the DSL
* Using `$global` variables carefully (for simplicity)

---

## 🛠️ Ideas to Extend This DSL

* ⏱ Add task dependencies: `depends_on "build"`
* 📁 Auto-load all `*.task.rb` files in a folder
* 🧪 Add built-in task for testing or linting
* 🌍 Add environment flags (e.g., `ENV['DEPLOY_ENV']`)
* 📄 Output help: `--help` or `list`

Would you like:

* A version using a class-based DSL?
* Integration with Rake or Thor?
* A RubyGem package layout?

Let me know, and I can scaffold the next level too!
