Yes â€” the principle **"Exceptional devs keep models focused on persistence logic"** means your Rails models should **primarily handle database interactions**, not be overloaded with business logic, control flow, or unrelated responsibilities.

This aligns with the **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP), one of the pillars of clean architecture.

## ðŸš« **What Not to Do in Models**

Hereâ€™s a common mistake:

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  def process_payment
    # Calls Stripe, sends email, logs event, updates inventory
  end

  def send_notification
    NotificationMailer.order_placed(self).deliver_now
  end

  def generate_invoice_pdf
    # Uses Prawn to render and save a PDF
  end
end
```

This model is doing **way too much**: payment, emails, PDF rendering â€” all side-effects that donâ€™t belong in persistence logic.

---

## âœ… **What to Do Instead (Lean Model Example)**

Keep models focused on:

* **Associations**
* **Scopes**
* **Basic validations**
* **Simple data transformations**

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :line_items

  validates :status, inclusion: { in: %w[pending paid shipped] }

  scope :recent, -> { where("created_at >= ?", 1.week.ago) }

  def total_price
    line_items.sum(&:price)
  end
end
```

All side-effect-heavy logic (payments, emails, exports) is **delegated** to service objects.

---

## ðŸ§± Supporting Objects (Service-Oriented Architecture)

* **`OrderProcessor`** â€“ handles payments, status changes
* **`OrderNotifier`** â€“ handles emails or webhooks
* **`InvoiceGenerator`** â€“ generates PDF invoices

Example:

```ruby
# app/services/order_processor.rb
class OrderProcessor
  def initialize(order)
    @order = order
  end

  def call
    ChargeCustomer.call(@order)
    UpdateInventory.call(@order)
    OrderNotifier.new(@order).notify_user
  end
end
```

Now your `Order` model remains focused on the database â€” **clean, testable, and extensible**.

## ðŸš¦Why This Matters

| Benefit             | Explanation                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Testability**     | Easier to test models and services in isolation         |
| **Reusability**     | Logic can be reused across jobs, controllers, CLI, etc. |
| **Readability**     | Clear responsibilities make code easier to understand   |
| **Maintainability** | Small changes don't cause side-effects elsewhere        |
