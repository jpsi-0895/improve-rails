To check if a `category` object is **empty or not** in Rails, your approach depends on **what `category` is**:

---

### üß© 1. **If `category` is an ActiveRecord object**

```ruby
if category.present?
  # category exists and is not nil
else
  # category is nil or blank
end
```

* `present?` = not `nil` and not empty
* `blank?` = `nil`, empty string, or empty collection

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```ruby
category = Category.find_by(slug: params[:slug])

if category.present?
  # Do something with the category
else
  # Handle case where category is nil (not found)
end
```

---

### üì¶ 2. **If `category` is a collection (like `@category.blogs`)**

```ruby
if category.any?
  # At least one record is present
end
```

Or:

```ruby
if category.empty?
  # No associated records
end
```

Or more idiomatically:

```ruby
if category.blank?
  # category is nil or has no records
end
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 3. **Safe Navigation (avoid `nil` errors)**

```ruby
if category&.blogs&.any?
  # Category exists and has blogs
else
  # Either category is nil, or no blogs
end
```

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `category.nil?`         | Exactly nil                     |
| `category.blank?`       | `nil` or empty                  |
| `category.present?`     | Not nil and not empty           |
| `category.any?`         | Collection has items            |
