If you're looking to understand or use a **query builder in Ruby on Rails**, you're in luck — **ActiveRecord** itself is Rails' powerful and expressive built-in query builder.

However, depending on what you mean by "query builder", here are several directions we can explore:

---

## 🎯 Common Meanings of “Rails Query Builder”

| Goal                                   | Tool/Approach                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Build SQL queries fluently in Ruby     | ✅ ActiveRecord query interface             |
| Dynamic query building (e.g., filters) | ✅ Scopes, lambdas, `ransack`, `searchkick` |
| Raw SQL builder                        | Arel (under the hood of ActiveRecord)      |
| No-code query UI (admin panels)        | ✅ ActiveAdmin, RailsAdmin                  |

---

## ✅ 1. **ActiveRecord as a Query Builder**

Rails models use ActiveRecord to fluently construct SQL:

```ruby
# Basic query
User.where(active: true)

# Chain queries
User.where(active: true).order(created_at: :desc).limit(10)

# Complex condition
User.where("age > ? AND city = ?", 25, "Delhi")

# Joins
User.joins(:posts).where(posts: { published: true })

# Aggregations
User.group(:city).count
```

## 🛠 2. **Dynamic Filters (Custom Query Builder)**

You can write your own filter system using lambdas or query objects:

### Example: `app/models/user.rb`

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
  scope :by_city, ->(city) { where(city: city) if city.present? }
  scope :older_than, ->(age) { where("age > ?", age) if age.present? }
end
```

Then in your controller or service:

```ruby
users = User.active.by_city(params[:city]).older_than(params[:min_age])
```

---

## 🔍 3. **Arel — Lower-Level Query Builder**

For custom SQL logic:

```ruby
users = User.arel_table
query = users.project(users[:name]).where(users[:age].gt(30))
sql = query.to_sql
# => SELECT "users"."name" FROM "users" WHERE "users"."age" > 30
```

You typically don’t need Arel unless you’re building complex query logic or libraries.

---

## 🔍 4. **Community Query Builders**

If you want more expressive or automatic filters:

### ✅ [`Ransack`](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack)

```ruby
User.ransack(name_cont: "john", age_gt: 25).result
```

Supports dynamic filter params:

```ruby
# /users?q[name_cont]=john&q[age_gt]=25
```

Good for filters in admin dashboards or APIs.

---

## 🔧 5. **Query Object Pattern (Advanced Use)**

Organize filters in dedicated objects:

```ruby
class UserQuery
  def initialize(scope = User.all, params = {})
    @scope = scope
    @params = params
  end

  def call
    filter_by_age
    filter_by_city
    @scope
  end

  private

  def filter_by_age
    @scope = @scope.where("age > ?", @params[:min_age]) if @params[:min_age]
  end

  def filter_by_city
    @scope = @scope.where(city: @params[:city]) if @params[:city]
  end
end
```

Then use:

```ruby
UserQuery.new(User.all, params).call
```

## 📦 Want UI-Level Query Builders?

For drag-and-drop/admin-style:

* **RailsAdmin**
* **ActiveAdmin**
* **Administrate**
* **Blazer** (for SQL dashboards)

| Use Case                      | Tool                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Standard queries              | ✅ ActiveRecord           |
| Dynamic filters in params     | ✅ Scopes or `Ransack`    |
| Low-level SQL builder         | Arel                     |
| Advanced query object pattern | Custom Ruby classes      |
| Admin UI filtering            | RailsAdmin / ActiveAdmin |
