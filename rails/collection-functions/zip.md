Here are several **important and commonly used functions/methods in Ruby**, similar in utility to `zip`, especially when working with arrays and enumerables:

---

### **1. `map` / `collect`**

Transforms each element in an array based on the block and returns a new array.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].map { |n| n * 2 }  # => [2, 4, 6]
```

---

### **2. `each`**

Iterates over each element in the array without modifying it.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each { |n| puts n }
```

---

### **3. `select` / `filter`**

Returns an array containing only the elements for which the block returns true.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4].select { |n| n.even? }  # => [2, 4]
```

---

### **4. `reject`**

Opposite of `select`. Returns elements for which the block is false.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4].reject { |n| n.even? }  # => [1, 3]
```

---

### **5. `reduce` / `inject`**

Combines all elements by applying a binary operation.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(:+)  # => 10
```

---

### **6. `find` / `detect`**

Returns the first element that matches the condition.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4].find { |n| n > 2 }  # => 3
```

---

### **7. `include?`**

Checks if an array includes a specific element.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].include?(2)  # => true
```

---

### **8. `any?`, `all?`, `none?`, `one?`**

Boolean checks on array elements:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].any? { |n| n > 2 }    # => true
[1, 2, 3].all? { |n| n > 0 }    # => true
[1, 2, 3].none? { |n| n < 0 }   # => true
[1, 2, 3].one? { |n| n == 2 }   # => true
```

---

### **9. `sort` / `sort_by`**

Sorts array elements.

```ruby
[3, 1, 2].sort               # => [1, 2, 3]
["apple", "pear"].sort_by(&:length)  # => ["pear", "apple"]
```

---

### **10. `group_by`**

Groups elements based on a block result.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4].group_by { |n| n.even? }
# => {false=>[1, 3], true=>[2, 4]}
```

---

These methods are extremely helpful when working with collections, and theyâ€™re also commonly discussed in **interviews and coding assessments**. Would you like examples of when to use them in real Rails code?
