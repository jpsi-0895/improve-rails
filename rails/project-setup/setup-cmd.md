Creating a Rails project with advanced options and settings can really give you an edge in terms of flexibility and customization. While the basic Rails project creation command is fairly simple, you can use a wide variety of options and configurations to tailor the project to your exact needs. Below are some **exceptional skills** and **advanced techniques** for creating Rails projects with more powerful features.

### 1. **Basic Project Creation**:

The most basic Rails project creation command is:

```bash
rails new my_project
```

But here's where the "exceptional skills" come into play. You can add various options to this command to modify the generated project.


### 2. **Specifying Database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

By default, Rails uses **SQLite** for development and test databases. However, you can specify which database you want to use at project creation time.

* **PostgreSQL**:

  ```bash
  rails new my_project --database=postgresql
  ```

* **MySQL**:

  ```bash
  rails new my_project --database=mysql
  ```

* **SQLite** (default, no need to specify unless you're using a different database in production):

  ```bash
  rails new my_project --database=sqlite3
  ```

### 3. **Include Specific Gems** (Tailwind CSS, Devise, etc.)

You can include gems during the project creation by using the `--skip` or `--skip-gemfile` options and adding them afterward, or using third-party gem integrations.

#### Example: Add **Devise** for authentication:

```bash
rails new my_project --skip-active-storage --skip-action-cable --skip-spring --skip-test --skip-javascript
```

Then manually add Devise to the Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise'
```

And run:

```bash
bundle install
rails generate devise:install
```

For **Tailwind CSS** integration, run:

```bash
rails new my_project --skip-javascript --skip-spring --skip-test
```

Then install Tailwind:

```bash
yarn add tailwindcss
rails generate tailwindcss:install
```

### 4. **Skip Some Default Components** (`--skip-` options)

Rails generates a lot of boilerplate that you might not need, especially for more specific or minimalist applications. The `--skip-` flags let you skip these components.

#### Common `--skip-` options:

* `--skip-action-mailer`: Skip email functionality.
* `--skip-action-cable`: Skip ActionCable for WebSockets.
* `--skip-spring`: Skip Spring (the Rails application preloader).
* `--skip-active-storage`: Skip Active Storage (file uploads).
* `--skip-javascript`: Skip JavaScript, useful if you're using a different front-end framework.
* `--skip-test`: Skip test framework (if you plan to use RSpec or another testing framework).

#### Example: Skipping some components for a minimal API project:

```bash
rails new my_api_project --skip-javascript --skip-active-storage --skip-test --api
```

This generates a **Rails API** only app, which doesn't include the default front-end views or tests.

### 5. **Create an API-only Application** (without View Layer)

For building APIs, you donâ€™t need Rails to generate the views or other front-end related files. You can use the `--api` flag to generate an API-only app.

```bash
rails new my_api_project --api --database=postgresql
```

This will set up an app optimized for API usage by skipping the unnecessary view layers (HTML, CSS, JS), and you can focus entirely on building your API endpoints.


### 6. **Add Docker Support**

If you plan to use Docker for containerization, you can easily add Docker support after creating the project. First, create a new project:

```bash
rails new my_project
```

Then, set up Docker by creating a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file to containerize your Rails app. A basic `Dockerfile` for Rails might look like:

```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.0.1

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs postgresql-client

# Set up working directory
WORKDIR /myapp
COPY . /myapp

# Install gems
RUN bundle install

# Precompile assets
RUN rails assets:precompile

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

And for `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - ".:/myapp"
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```


### 7. **Custom Template**

If you have a standard set of gems, configurations, or generators you want to include in every Rails project, you can create a custom template.

#### Example: Use a custom Rails template from GitHub or your local repository:

```bash
rails new my_project -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/rails-templates/master/custom_template.rb
```

You can use this template to automate the setup of commonly used gems (like `Devise`, `Tailwind`, `RSpec`, etc.) and other configurations.


### 8. **Add Multiple Environment Configurations**

If you want to add configurations for multiple environments (e.g., development, test, production) when creating the app, you can do this manually or by creating environment-specific configuration files. For example, you can use different database configurations for each environment in the `database.yml` file.


### 9. **Using `--skip-bundle` (Optional Bundling)**

If you want to create the Rails app but **skip the `bundle install` step** (perhaps to set up your own environment first), you can add the `--skip-bundle` option:

```bash
rails new my_project --skip-bundle
```

This way, you can run `bundle install` yourself later, or customize the Gemfile before doing so.

### 10. **Internationalization (I18n) Ready**

If you're building a multi-lingual application, you can add a ready-made I18n configuration by specifying the locales.

```bash
rails new my_project --skip-test --skip-javascript --skip-spring --locale=fr
```

This creates a project where French (`fr`) is the default locale, and you can add other translations for different languages.

### 11. **Creating a Gem-based Rails Application**

If you're developing a Rails engine or a gem, you can start with a specific gem template for Rails engines:

```bash
rails plugin new my_engine --mountable
```

This creates a mountable Rails engine which can be included in other Rails applications.


### Conclusion: Supercharging Your Rails Project Creation

While the basic `rails new` command creates a standard Rails app, you can supercharge it with various options for **customized databases**, **third-party gem integrations**, **containerization** with Docker, **API-only apps**, and much more. Knowing these tricks will allow you to speed up your workflow and tailor each project to your specific needs right from the start.
