Here's a detailed breakdown of a typical **Rails project structure**, including **important files and folders**, their **purpose**, and insights into **exceptional skills** that experienced developers apply when working with them.

## 🏗️ **Rails Project Structure Overview**

When you run:

```bash
rails new my_app
```

It generates this file/folder structure:

```
my_app/
├── app/
├── bin/
├── config/
├── db/
├── lib/
├── log/
├── public/
├── storage/
├── test/ or spec/
├── tmp/
├── vendor/
├── .gitignore
├── Gemfile
├── Rakefile
└── README.md
```

Now, let's dive into each **folder or file**, with advanced notes on how experienced developers use them.

---

## 📁 `app/` — **Core MVC Application Code**

Contains your models, views, controllers, and additional layers.

### Key Subfolders:

| Folder         | Purpose                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `models/`      | Your app’s data logic (ActiveRecord models).                             |
| `controllers/` | Handle user requests, manage flow.                                       |
| `views/`       | HTML templates and UI rendering.                                         |
| `helpers/`     | View helpers; used for reusable methods in templates.                    |
| `mailers/`     | Classes for sending emails using ActionMailer.                           |
| `channels/`    | WebSocket logic (ActionCable).                                           |
| `jobs/`        | Background job classes (ActiveJob).                                      |
| `assets/`      | Legacy pipeline for JS/CSS/images (replaced by importmaps or Webpacker). |

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Organize `app/services/` and `app/forms/` for business logic and form objects.
* Use `app/serializers/` for API JSON serialization (e.g., with `ActiveModel::Serializer` or `fast_jsonapi`).
* Use POROs (Plain Old Ruby Objects) in `app/lib` or `app/services` for cleaner code separation.

---

## 📁 `bin/` — **Executable Scripts**

* Contains scripts like `rails`, `rake`, and `setup`.
* **Tip:** Always keep this folder under version control.

## 📁 `config/` — **Application Configuration**

Central hub for routes, environments, database, and initializers.

### Key Files & Folders:

| File/Folder           | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `routes.rb`           | Defines URL routes → controller actions.               |
| `application.rb`      | Global configuration for the app.                      |
| `environments/`       | Per-environment settings (dev/test/prod).              |
| `initializers/`       | Startup files for configuring gems or custom settings. |
| `credentials.yml.enc` | Encrypted secrets (API keys, passwords).               |
| `storage.yml`         | Active Storage file service settings.                  |
| `locales/`            | I18n translation files.                                |

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Use `initializers/` to configure third-party gems (like Devise, Sidekiq, Pundit).
* Load environment variables securely using `ENV` and `credentials`.
* Use custom initializers for application-specific constants and services.


## 📁 `db/` — **Database-Related Files**

| File/Folder | Purpose                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `schema.rb` | Current database schema (auto-generated). |
| `migrate/`  | Migration files for schema changes.       |
| `seeds.rb`  | Data seeding logic (initial dummy data).  |

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Use `seeds.rb` or custom `db/seeds/*.rb` scripts for different environments.
* Use `structure.sql` instead of `schema.rb` if using advanced DB features (e.g., PostgreSQL extensions).


## 📁 `lib/` — **Custom Code Library**

| Subfolder    | Purpose                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `lib/tasks/` | Custom Rake tasks.           |
| `lib/`       | Utility modules or services. |

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Organize custom reusable modules, parsers, or integrations.
* Add `lib/` to autoload paths in `application.rb`:

  ```ruby
  config.autoload_paths << Rails.root.join('lib')
  ```


## 📁 `log/` — **Application Logs**

Contains logs for development, test, production.

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Monitor logs via tools like Lograge or external logging services (Datadog, ELK).
* Tweak logging level in `config/environments/*.rb` using:

  ```ruby
  config.log_level = :debug
  ```


## 📁 `public/` — **Static Assets**

Used to store static files directly served by the web server (like `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`).


## 📁 `storage/` — **Active Storage Files**

Holds blobs and variants of uploaded files when using `ActiveStorage`.


## 📁 `test/` or `spec/` — **Tests**

* `test/` is for Minitest (default).
* `spec/` is for RSpec (commonly used by advanced devs).

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Structure tests using `factories/`, `shared_examples/`, and `support/`.
* Integrate tools like FactoryBot, Faker, and SimpleCov.


## 📁 `tmp/` — **Temporary Files**

Used for caches, compiled assets, and other temporary data.

> Automatically cleared, often ignored in version control.


## 📁 `vendor/` — **Third-Party Code**

Used rarely in modern Rails. Typically for vendored JS or Rails engines.


## 📄 `Gemfile` — **Dependencies**

Defines all Ruby gems your app uses.

### 🔧 Exceptional Skills:

* Group gems by environment (`:development`, `:test`, `:production`).
* Use versions carefully to avoid compatibility issues.


## 📄 `Rakefile` — **Custom Tasks**

Defines rake tasks (like `db:migrate`, `assets:precompile`).

> Advanced devs write custom rake tasks in `lib/tasks/*.rake`.


## 📄 `.gitignore` — **Ignored Files**

Specifies which files should be excluded from Git (like logs, tmp, secrets).


## ✅ Pro-Level Rails Folder Additions

| Folder             | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/services/`    | Business logic layer (e.g., payment processing, data importers) |
| `app/queries/`     | Complex ActiveRecord queries (using Query Objects)              |
| `app/forms/`       | Form objects for multi-step forms or custom validation          |
| `app/policies/`    | Authorization logic (e.g., Pundit)                              |
| `app/serializers/` | JSON serializers for APIs                                       |
| `app/commands/`    | Command pattern classes for actions like user registration      |
