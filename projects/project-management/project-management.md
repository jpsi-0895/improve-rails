To build a system that manages **project details** including files (PDF/images), timelines, costs, team members, and user roles, you need a well-structured **Rails database schema** with **associations** and support for **file uploads** and **permissions**.

## 🏗️ **Key Features to Cover**

| Feature               | Model Field or Association        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Project info          | `Project` model                   |
| File uploads          | `ActiveStorage` attachments       |
| Finalization/delivery | `finalized_at`, `delivery_date`   |
| Token money / cost    | `token_amount`, `total_cost`      |
| Project Manager       | Association with `User`           |
| Team members          | Many-to-many (Users <-> Projects) |
| Permissions           | Roles (`admin`, `manager`, etc.)  |

## 🗂️ Suggested Models & Relationships

### 1. **User**

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :managed_projects, class_name: 'Project', foreign_key: 'manager_id'
  has_many :project_assignments
  has_many :projects, through: :project_assignments
  has_many :roles, through: :role_assignments
end
```

---

### 2. **Project**

```ruby
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :manager, class_name: 'User'
  has_many :project_assignments
  has_many :users, through: :project_assignments

  has_many_attached :documents  # ActiveStorage for files (PDFs, images)

  validates :name, :delivery_date, :total_cost, presence: true
end
```

---

### 3. **ProjectAssignment** (Join table for team members)

```ruby
class ProjectAssignment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :project
end
```

---

### 4. **Role & RoleAssignment**

```ruby
class Role < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :role_assignments
  has_many :users, through: :role_assignments
end

class RoleAssignment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :role
end
```

## 🗃️ Suggested Migration Summary

```bash
rails g model User name:string email:string password_digest:string
rails g model Role name:string
rails g model RoleAssignment user:references role:references
rails g model Project name:string description:text manager:references{User} token_amount:decimal total_cost:decimal finalized_at:datetime delivery_date:date
rails g model ProjectAssignment user:references project:references
```

Then run:

```bash
rails active_storage:install
rails db:migrate
```

---

## 🧠 Example Use Cases

### Uploading Files:

```ruby
@project.documents.attach(params[:documents])  # Accepts multiple
```

### Displaying Documents:

```erb
<% @project.documents.each do |doc| %>
  <%= link_to doc.filename, url_for(doc) %>
<% end %>
```

---

## 🔐 Permissions

Using roles like:

* **Admin** – full access
* **Manager** – can assign team and manage project
* **Team Member** – view/edit based on assignment

Integrate with:

* `Pundit` (policy-based)
* or `CanCanCan` (ability-based)

## 📌 Optional Enhancements

| Feature        | Tool                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| File preview   | PDF.js for inline PDFs                   |
| Notifications  | ActionMailer or Noticed                  |
| Team chat      | ActionCable for real-time                |
| Timeline/Gantt | JS libraries (e.g., Frappe Gantt, D3.js) |
