Ah, you want to **connect a Rails model to a specific existing table name** in the database (like if the table name doesn't follow the Rails conventions)? No problem â€” Rails makes that super easy.

### âœ… How to Connect a Model to a Specific Table Name

In your model file, you can manually specify the table name like this:

```ruby
# app/models/customer_data.rb
class CustomerData < ApplicationRecord
  self.table_name = 'customers_table'
end
```

So even if the table is named `customers_table`, and your model is named `CustomerData`, ActiveRecord will map it correctly.

### ðŸ”„ Example:

```ruby
class LegacyUser < ApplicationRecord
  self.table_name = 'legacy_users_data'
end
```

Now you can do:

```ruby
LegacyUser.all
LegacyUser.find(1)
```

And itâ€™ll query the `legacy_users_data` table.

---

### ðŸš¨ Notes

- If your **primary key isnâ€™t `id`**, you can also set that:

```ruby
self.primary_key = 'user_uuid'
```

- No need to generate a migration â€” youâ€™re using existing tables.
