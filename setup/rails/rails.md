Got it — you want to set up a **Rails project** to connect to an **existing MySQL database** and work with its tables (i.e., not creating new tables but using what's already there).

Here’s how to do it, step by step:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create a New Rails Project (without overwriting DB)

If you haven’t created the Rails project yet, run:

```bash
rails new my_app_name -d mysql
cd my_app_name
```

This creates a new Rails app configured to use MySQL.

If your project already exists, skip to Step 2.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Configure `database.yml`

Edit the config file to point to your existing MySQL database:

```yaml
# config/database.yml
default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8mb4
  pool: 5
  username: your_mysql_user
  password: your_mysql_password
  host: localhost

development:
  <<: *default
  database: your_existing_database_name
```

Then install the MySQL adapter:

```bash
bundle add mysql2
bundle install
```

Test the connection:

```bash
rails db
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Generate Models Without Creating Tables

Let’s say your existing table is called `customers`. You can generate a model **without a migration** like this:

```bash
rails generate model Customer --skip-migration
```

Then open the model file (`app/models/customer.rb`) and make sure it’s good to go. You don’t need to define columns — Rails will detect them from the DB.

Now you can start using ActiveRecord like:

```ruby
Customer.first
Customer.where(active: true)
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Use `annotate` Gem (Optional but Helpful)

You can use the [`annotate`](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) gem to automatically show table columns in your model files:

```bash
bundle add annotate
bundle exec annotate
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Done! Play With Your Data

Now you can jump into the Rails console and work with your existing DB:

```bash
rails console
```

Try:

```ruby
Customer.all
Customer.find_by(email: "test@example.com")
```
