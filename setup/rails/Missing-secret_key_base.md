You're seeing this error:

```
raise ArgumentError, "Missing `secret_key_base` for '#{Rails.env}' environment, set this string with `bin/rails credentials:edit`"
```

This means **Rails cannot find the secret key** required for encrypting sessions, cookies, etc., in your current environment (likely production).

## ✅ Fixing `Missing secret_key_base` in Rails

### 🔧 Option 1: Set `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in the environment (Best for Production)

In **production**, Rails expects `SECRET_KEY_BASE` to be set as an environment variable.

To generate one:
```bash
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake secret
```

Then set it:
```bash
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_generated_secret_key
```

Or add it to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or production config.

If you're using a process manager (like `systemd`, `foreman`, or Docker), pass it in the environment.

---

### 🔐 Option 2: Use `credentials.yml.enc` (Rails 5.2+)

If you're managing secrets using Rails credentials, run:

```bash
EDITOR="nano" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

Then add:

```yaml
production:
  secret_key_base: your_generated_secret_key
```

Save and commit the encrypted file (`config/credentials.yml.enc`) and `config/master.key`.

If you're on a server, make sure `config/master.key` exists, or set `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` as an environment variable:

```bash
export RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your_master_key
```

---

### 🚫 Don’t Hardcode Secrets in `secrets.yml`

Hardcoding secrets in `config/secrets.yml` is deprecated (and unsafe in production). Use `credentials` or environment variables.

---

## ✅ Summary: What You Should Do

If this is production:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake secret
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_generated_key
```

Then start the server.
