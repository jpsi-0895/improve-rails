Sure! Let's dive a little deeper into some of the concepts with more examples and explanations.

---

### ✅ **1. Instance Methods and Variables**

Instance methods belong to **individual objects** of the class, and they can access **instance variables** that are specific to that object. These variables are prefixed with `@` (e.g., `@make`, `@model`).

#### Example: Instance Methods and Variables

```ruby
class Car
  # Constructor (initialize) method
  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make      # instance variable @make
    @model = model    # instance variable @model
  end

  # Instance method to get car details
  def details
    "#{@make} #{@model}"   # Accessing instance variables inside the instance method
  end
end

# Creating a new Car object
my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")

# Calling the instance method
puts my_car.details  # => "Toyota Camry"
```

* **Instance Variables**: `@make` and `@model` hold the values specific to each instance of the `Car` class.
* **Instance Methods**: The `details` method can access and return these values.

---

### ✅ **2. Class Methods**

Class methods are not tied to specific instances of a class but instead to the class itself. You define class methods with `self` in the method definition.

#### Example: Class Methods

```ruby
class Car
  # Class method (belongs to the class, not the instance)
  def self.total_cars
    100  # Example fixed total number of cars
  end
end

# Calling a class method
puts Car.total_cars  # => 100
```

* **Class Methods**: The method `self.total_cars` is called on the class `Car`, not an instance of `Car`.

You can also use `class << self` to define multiple class methods in one place.

```ruby
class Car
  class << self
    def total_cars
      100
    end

    def car_type
      "Sedan"
    end
  end
end

puts Car.total_cars  # => 100
puts Car.car_type    # => "Sedan"
```

---

### ✅ **3. Access Control: Public, Private, Protected**

Ruby provides three levels of access control for methods: **public**, **private**, and **protected**.

#### Example: Public Methods

By default, all methods are **public** unless specified otherwise.

```ruby
class Car
  def drive
    puts "Driving..."
  end
end

my_car = Car.new
my_car.drive  # This is allowed, since `drive` is a public method
```

#### Example: Private Methods

Private methods can only be called within the **class** and are not accessible from outside the class (even by instances of the class).

```ruby
class Car
  def drive
    puts "Driving..."
    check_engine  # Calling private method from within the same class
  end

  private

  def check_engine
    puts "Checking engine..."
  end
end

my_car = Car.new
my_car.drive  # Allowed
my_car.check_engine  # Error: private method `check_engine` called for #<Car:...>
```

#### Example: Protected Methods

Protected methods are like private methods, but they can also be called by **subclasses** and **instances of the same class**.

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(make)
    @make = make
  end

  protected

  def make
    @make
  end
end

class SportsCar < Car
  def show_make
    puts make  # Accessing protected method in the subclass
  end
end

sports_car = SportsCar.new("Ferrari")
sports_car.show_make  # Allowed: "Ferrari"
```

---

### ✅ **4. Constructor Method (`initialize`)**

The `initialize` method in Ruby is a special method that gets called when you create a new instance of a class using `.new`.

#### Example: Constructor Method

```ruby
class Car
  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make  # Instance variable
    @model = model
  end

  def details
    "#{@make} #{@model}"  # Returns the make and model of the car
  end
end

# Creating a new instance of Car
my_car = Car.new("Honda", "Civic")
puts my_car.details  # => "Honda Civic"
```

* **`initialize` method**: This is a special method called when a new object is instantiated with `.new`. It sets up the object by initializing instance variables (`@make`, `@model`).

---

### ✅ **5. Getter and Setter Methods**

Ruby provides a convenient way to generate getter and setter methods for instance variables using `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor`.

#### Example: Getter and Setter Methods

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :make, :model  # Creates both getter and setter methods for :make and :model

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make
    @model = model
  end
end

my_car = Car.new("Toyota", "Corolla")

# Using getter methods
puts my_car.make   # => "Toyota"
puts my_car.model  # => "Corolla"

# Using setter methods
my_car.make = "Honda"
puts my_car.make   # => "Honda"
```

* **`attr_accessor`** creates both a **getter** and a **setter** for each specified variable.
* **`attr_reader`** creates only a **getter**.
* **`attr_writer`** creates only a **setter**.

---

### ✅ **6. Inheritance and Method Overriding**

Ruby supports **inheritance**, meaning a subclass can inherit methods from its parent class. You can also **override** methods in the subclass to customize behavior.

#### Example: Inheritance

```ruby
class Vehicle
  def move
    puts "Vehicle is moving..."
  end
end

class Car < Vehicle  # Inheriting from Vehicle class
  def move
    puts "Car is driving..."  # Overriding the move method
  end
end

vehicle = Vehicle.new
vehicle.move  # => "Vehicle is moving..."

car = Car.new
car.move  # => "Car is driving..."
```

* The `Car` class **inherits** the `move` method from `Vehicle`, but **overrides** it with its own version.

---

### ✅ **7. Modules (Mixins)**

In Ruby, you can use **modules** to share reusable code across different classes. Modules can't be instantiated, but they can be included in classes to add methods to them.

#### Example: Including a Module

```ruby
module Drivable
  def drive
    puts "Driving..."
  end
end

class Car
  include Drivable  # Including the Drivable module
end

class Boat
  include Drivable  # Boats can also drive (in this case, we mean "sail")
end

car = Car.new
car.drive  # => "Driving..."

boat = Boat.new
boat.drive  # => "Driving..."
```

* **`include`**: Makes the module's methods available as **instance methods** in the class.
* **`extend`**: Makes the module's methods available as **class methods**.

---

### ✅ **8. Class Variables**

Class variables are shared by all instances of a class and can be accessed using `@@` syntax.

#### Example: Class Variables

```ruby
class Car
  @@total_cars = 0  # Class variable

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @@total_cars += 1
  end

  def self.total_cars
    @@total_cars
  end
end

Car.new("Toyota", "Camry")
Car.new("Honda", "Civic")

puts Car.total_cars  # => 2
```

* **Class Variables**: `@@total_cars` is shared by all instances of `Car`, so it keeps track of the number of car objects created.

| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance Methods**           | Defined with `def`, can access instance variables (`@var`), called on objects.                  |
| **Class Methods**              | Defined with `def self.method_name`, called on the class itself.                                |
| **Access Control**             | `public`, `private`, and `protected` for controlling method visibility.                         |
| **Constructor (`initialize`)** | Sets up object when using `.new`, initializes instance variables.                               |
| **Getter/Setter**              | Use `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, `attr_accessor` for creating methods.                         |
| **Inheritance**                | A class can inherit from another class using `<`, methods can be overridden.                    |
| **Modules**                    | Mix reusable code across classes with `include` (instance methods) or `extend` (class methods). |
| **Class Variables**            | Shared variables across all instances of a class, prefixed with `@@`.                           |
